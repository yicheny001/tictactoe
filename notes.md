### Instructor Comments

+ This looks like a very good start, Yichen.
+ I think you've made good progress working with the service object class. I think you could add more of the methods on your model classes to service objects, especially from the Game class (update board, etc).
+ I also notice that some of the methods are a little long. It would be great to split some of the logic into smaller helper methods (also on the Game class).
+ It looks like you still have some functionality to add on the computer playing. Looking forward to seeing what you'll add next as you continue working on it.
